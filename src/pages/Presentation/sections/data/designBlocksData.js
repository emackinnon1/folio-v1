Handled and processed data that was used by over 20 of Guild's 26 teams; our data needed to be top notch and our services highly performant for the business to function and flourish.",
          "Led an effort to free engineers from manually onboarding new partners through code. This involved leveraging JsonLogic in a frontend portal to allow implementation and delivery managers to build the business logic needed instead of having engineers log hours doing so; this reduced the amount of touch points needed for a new onboarding and allowed for lowered business costs as well as developer time to be spent elsewhere.",
          "Leveraged the AWS ecosystem (AWS Lambda, Appsync GraphQL APIs, PostgresQL RDS, DynamoDB, Simple Queue Service, etc) to build event-driven, distributed microservices to interact with other arms and systems of the business. As a part of the business's most central development team, I led efforts to improve performance, throughput and data quality of our services in order to better serve our consumers, both internally at Guild and exogenous customers.",
          "Was a key player in our endeavor to consolidate domains and build out shared systems with another central team in order to improve and simplify our architecture. This resulted in a merge of data, domains and design that benefited other teams as it reduced the number of consumer calls needed to obtain data required for business and user-centered logic that was utilized by many corners of the organization.",
